  * Completions lists
  * AOT Diagnostic messages
  * Quick info
  * Go to definition
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): This extension provides code formatting for your TS and SCSS files. _Recommended configuration is included within this seed project._
* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint): Integrates the tslint linter for the TypeScript language into VS Code. This is helpful to see linting errors directly in your VS Code.
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more.

### Optional extensions

* [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer): This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use.
* [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag): Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tag, same as Visual Studio IDE does.
* [Log File Highlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emilast.LogFileHighlighter): Adds color highlighting to log files to make it easier to follow the flow of log events and identify problems.

* [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense): Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames.
* [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments): Improve your code commenting by annotating with alert, informational, TODOs, and more!
